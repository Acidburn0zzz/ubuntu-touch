# Ubuntu Touch

## A simple and beautiful mobile OS for everyone!

[Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com) is the touch-friendly mobile version of the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) operating system. Originally designed and developed by Canonical, it now lives on in the UBports community.

Ubuntu Touch offers a completely different approach to using your smartphone or tablet than using say Android or iOS. The intuitive user interface allows you to access all of your phones features by swiping from the edges of the screen to access your apps, tools and settings all with one hand and no on-screen buttons. It looks great and feels smooth.
